                <h2>The Aftermath of World War 2</h2>
                <p>
                    The war caused over 60 million deaths and left cities and economies in ruin. Germany was divided and Japan became a democracy.
                    The United Nations was created to promote peace and decolonization of empires, which led to the beginning of the Cold War.
                    Much of Asia and Europe was destroyed, prompting large reconstruction efforts.
